/* EXERCISE 1
Enumerate and describe the main datatypes in JavaScript. Try to explain the concepts as you were speaking to a 12 years old.
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

The main datatypes in JaScript are:

NUMBERS // Numbers can be integers or floats
5 // integer -- an integral number
5.3 // float --> a floating point number
or 5.5555

Variable examples:

let number = 5
let number = 5.5
let number = 5.555

STRINGS // Practically a "Text"
A string must be surrounded by a String Delimiter that can be:

// Double quotes
"String Delimiter"

// Single quotes
'String Delimiter'

// Backticks
`String Delimiter`

Variable examples:

let name = "Emilian"
let surname = 'Kasemi'
let profession = `Developer`
let justKidding = "PS: Just kidding!"

console.log(name + " " + surname + " is" + " a" + " " + profession)
console.log(justKidding)

BOOLEAN // TRUE or FALSE

5 > 3 // --> True because 5 IS greater than 3
10 < 2 // --> False because 10 IS NOT less than 2

// or using "strictly equal" sign
"Emilian" === "Emilian" // sure it is true because both datatypes and values are equal

// or using "is not equal" sign
"Emilian" !== "Emilian" // --> True because "Emilian IS NOT EQUAL to Emilian" is a true statement, so this statement is TRUE

PS: We also have Null and Undefined values:

undefined // variable declared but not defined yet
null // not existing, total absence of value



/* EXERCISE 2
Try to describe what a variable is, in your own words.
*/ 

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

A VARIABLE is practically an INFO BOX. A box which contains information or data. The data can be of various categories (Datatypes)
These data or information has values and these values can change over time. This is why it's called a "variable", it varies, it can change.

For example the data or information might be Strive School: 

school (datatype) // this is for example in the category of "schools" --> is the same thing as saying 10 is in the category of NUMBERS (number datatype)

let striveSchool // immagine if there was a "type --> school" of variables, striveSchool would be the name of a variable with type school

This can be specializations:

let fullStackDevelopmentClass = 50 // 50 can be a value. Meaning the number of people joining this class
// the variable fullStackDevelopmentClass is of type NUMBERS and has the value 50

let isJavaScriptTheMostDifficultLanguage = False; // This variable is of type BOOl and it gives a true or false value
// In this case Javascript is not teh mos diffucult language, so the value of this BOOL is FALSE

*** // Stands to you in choosing the name of the variable, but it is a good practice to ALWAYS choose meaningful names, 
// so when you come back to your code you can easily read it, you or someone else who will read it



/* EXERCISE 3
Write the code to execute an addition (a sum) of the numbers 12 and 20.
*/

/* WRITE YOUR CODE HERE */

let x = 12;
let y = 20;

let sum = x + y;

console.log(sum);

/* EXERCISE 4
Create a variable named x containing the number 12.
*/

/* WRITE YOUR CODE HERE */

let x = 12;

/* EXERCISE 5
Create a variable called name containing the string John Doe.
*/

/* WRITE YOUR CODE HERE */

let name = "John Doe"

/* EXERCISE 6
Execute a subtraction between the number 12 and the variable x, which is storing the value 12.
*/

/* WRITE YOUR CODE HERE */

let x = 12;

console.log(12 - x);


/* EXERCISE 7
Create two variables: name1 and name2. name1 is equal to john, name2 is equal to John.
Verify that name1 is different from name2. 
Verify then, that name1 and name2 are equals if both lowercase (without changing the value of name2).
*/

/* WRITE YOUR CODE HERE */

let name1;
let name2;

name1 = "john";
name2 = "John";

console.log(name1 === name2); // FALSE --> proves they are different

or:

console.log(name1 !== name2); // TRUE --> proves they are different

name2 = name2.toLowerCase;

console.log(name1 === name2); // proves they are the same without changing the value for name2



/* EXERCISE 8
Create a variable named x (its value must be less than 10). Write the code to print the literal value of x (ex.: if x is 1 print "one", if 5 print "five" etc.).
*/

/* WRITE YOUR CODE HERE */

let x = 5;

x = "five";

console.log(x);


/* EXERCISE 9
[Extra] Insert a value in a variable based on the resut of a ternary if (topic not covered during lesson, try to search it by yourself, tomorrow morning we'll discuss it together ;) )
*/

/* WRITE YOUR CODE HERE */

// ternary operator ===>>> condition ? expression_1 : expression_2;

// if statement example

let age = 15;
let lowerSpeedMessage;

if (speed > 90)
{
	lowerSpeedMessage = "Yes"
	console.log(lowerSpeedMessage);
} else

{
	lowerSpeedMessage = "No"
	console.log(lowerSpeedMessage);
}

// ternary operator example

let speed = 120;
let lowerSpeedMessage = speed > 90 ? 'yes' : 'no';

console.log(lowerSpeedMessage);
